# flact

### Motivation

I felt tired to create new project everytime in hackathon for similar purpose. Flack contains the basic component for Flask + React + Materializecss. This project can be used in production although the jsx are not compressed.

### Development

```bash
# I assume you know virtualenv.
$ pip3 install -r requirement.txt
$ python3 manage.py
> http://127.0.0.1
```

### Plan

- util/lib/model/type/config...
- pytest
- flake8
- mypy
- 3rd party oauth wrapper?


### Production

Well, if you need to make this project in production, gunicorn and nginx are your friends. :)
